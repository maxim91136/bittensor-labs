## v1.0.0-rc.21 (2025-12-05)

### Added
- Fear & Greed (F&G) UI: improved card layout with history matrix and a spoon-shaped gauge. Support for user-provided spoon graphics added (`assets/fng-spoon-*.webp`).
- `useFngGraphics()` loader to automatically switch spoon images for dark/light themes.

### Changed
- Ampelsystem (Volume Signal): tuned heuristics (tradedShare guard, hysteresis, soft strict-down rule, runtime override `STRICT_DOWN_ALWAYS_RED`) to reduce false positives and add debuggability.
- UI: moved historical points into the left matrix block and moved detailed "Last updated" into the info-badge tooltip (with optional visible label during iteration).
- Desktop layout: increased `fng-card` max-width on wide screens to improve spoon/gauge scale.

### Fixed
- Resolved a syntax regression in `script.js` (parse error during earlier edits) and validated parse via Node.
- Image handling: optimized supplied spoon PNGs to WebP and updated loader to prefer WebP assets.

### Notes
- This RC focuses on UI polish (F&G gauge visuals), UX for Ampelsystem alerts, and release documentation.
## v1.0.0-rc.21 (2025-12-05)

### Added
- Fear & Greed card: support for user-supplied spoon graphics with automatic WebP detection and fallback to SVG. Add `window.useFngGraphics(darkPath, lightPath)` to explicitly load custom images.

### Changed
- F&G UI: improved spoon visual fidelity — added optimized WebP assets (`assets/fng-spoon-dark.webp`, `assets/fng-spoon-light.webp`) and auto-loading during dashboard init.
- F&G layout: responsive adjustments so the card and spoon scale appropriately on wide (desktop) viewports (increased desktop max-width and larger spoon image on >=1000px).
- UX: Last-updated handling refined — kept source/updated data in the info-badge tooltip; temporary visible label added during testing was removed.

### Fixed
- Prevent visual duplication: removed conflicting inline SVG fallback when user graphics are present and ensured only the selected image is shown behind the needle.
- CSS: tuned positioning of spoon background and needle alignment across breakpoints.

### Notes
- Bumped `VERSION` to `v1.0.0-rc.21`.
- Commit includes updates to `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` to support the F&G graphic workflow and desktop sizing tweaks.
