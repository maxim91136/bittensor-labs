# Release Notes — v1.0.0-rc.16.7

**Release Date:** 2025-12-01

## Summary

Final CSS isolation fix for the Volume Signal System. Signal cards now properly maintain their default gray border while displaying the colored glow animation.

## Fixed

### CSS Isolation for Signal Cards
- **Root cause identified**: The default `.stat-card:hover` rule was applying green border-color to ALL stat-cards, including signal cards
- **Solution**: Added `:not()` selectors to exclude signal cards from green hover styling:
  ```css
  .stat-card:hover:not(.blink-green):not(.blink-red):not(.blink-yellow):not(.blink-orange)
  ```
- Signal cards now keep gray border (`rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`) in dark mode
- Signal cards now keep gray border (`#c0c0c0`) in light mode
- Green hover effect only applies to non-signal stat-cards
- Animation glow (box-shadow) continues uninterrupted during hover

## Technical Details

The fix required modifying the **source** of the problem rather than adding override rules:
- Previous attempts used `!important` overrides at the end of CSS file
- Correct solution: Exclude signal cards from the original hover rule using `:not()` pseudo-class selectors

## Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes. CSS-only fix.
