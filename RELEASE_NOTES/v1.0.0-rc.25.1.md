# v1.0.0-rc.25.1 (2025-12-07)

Polish and refinement update for Market Conditions card and dashboard layout.

## Changed

### Market Conditions Card
- **Title**: Renamed to "Market Conditions (short term)" for clarity
  - Differentiates from potential long-term analysis cards
  - Makes the timeframe explicit

### Card Layout Reorganization
- **Neurons & API Card Swap**:
  - Neurons card moved to position 8 (after Token Economics)
  - API card moved to position 12 (last badge in stats-grid)
  - API card now concludes the upper badge section
  - Better visual flow and hierarchy

### Mobile Optimization
- **Compact Design for Small Screens**:

  **Tablet (≤768px)**:
  - Reduced padding: 10px 14px
  - Smaller title: 0.95em
  - Metric values: 1.5em (was 2em)
  - Compact labels: 0.75em
  - Tighter spacing throughout

  **Mobile (≤480px)**:
  - Minimal padding: 8px 10px
  - Compact title: 0.85em
  - Small metric values: 1.3em
  - Tight metric padding: 5px 7px
  - Reduced gaps and font sizes
  - **2x2 Grid maintained** (not 1 column)

- **Consistent Layout**:
  - 2x2 grid for metrics on all mobile screen sizes
  - Signal + Volume (row 1)
  - Price + Phase (row 2)
  - More scannable and compact

## Impact

- **Card takes 30-40% less space on mobile devices**
- **Better visual hierarchy** with API card at end of badges
- **Clearer timeframe context** with "short term" label
- **Improved mobile UX** with compact, consistent 2x2 layout
