# v1.0.0-rc.21.3.2 (2025-12-06)

A backend/CI resiliency patch that reduces Taostats pressure and makes block-time collection more robust against transient rate limits.

## Highlights

- **Taostats block fetch resiliency:** Added retry logic with exponential backoff, jitter and support for `Retry-After` headers to handle `429` responses gracefully.
- **Reduced per-request pressure:** `per_page` reduced to `100` (previously 200) to lower burst load on Taostats.
- **Lowered sample size:** Block fetches are capped to **100** blocks per run (was 200 in an earlier call). This uses a single request per run with current `per_page` settings and is sufficient to estimate average block time.
- **CI behavior on 429:** When the Taostats API returns `429`, the job will now emit a warning and exit successfully (no CI failure). Persistent non-429 errors still fail the job to surface genuine issues.

## Files changed (high level)

- `.github/scripts/fetch_block_time.py` — retries, backoff, Retry-After handling, `per_page=100`, default `num_blocks=100` and safe CI behavior on rate-limits.

## Notes

- This is a low-risk maintenance release focused on resilience and operational stability. Recommended: monitor the scheduled runs for 24–48 hours to confirm reduced 429 frequency.
