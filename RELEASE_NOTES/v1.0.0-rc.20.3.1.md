# v1.0.0-rc.20.3.1 (2025-12-05)

## Summary
This tiny follow-up release fixes the Light Mode holiday snowfall contrast by choosing a darker blue for snowflakes and unifying Light Mode behavior.

## Fixed
- Darkened Light Mode snowflakes for better contrast across a range of displays; unified behavior for both `prefers-color-scheme: light` and the `body.light-bg` toggle.

## Notes
- This is a patch release post RC20.3 focused on visual contrast; includes no functional changes beyond UI styling.
