# v1.0.0-rc.25.3.2 (2025-12-08)

Documentation and cleanup release - removing legacy code and updating docs to reflect RC25+ features.

## Changed

### Documentation Overhaul
**README.md completely updated** to reflect current state of the dashboard:

- **Version**: Updated from RC23.7 to RC25.3.1 (now RC25.3.2)
- **Highlights**: Updated to showcase Market Conditions Card as main feature
- **Market Conditions Intelligence Section**: Comprehensive documentation added
  - Four key metrics explained (Signal, Volume, Price, Trend)
  - Market Phase Analysis description
  - Moving Averages Dashboard documentation
  - Data quality & transparency features
  - Visual design principles

### Legacy Code Removal
**Deprecated Ampelsystem cleanup**:

The standalone Volume Signal Card (Ampelsystem) was replaced by the Market Conditions Card in RC25, but legacy code remained. Now fully cleaned up:

- **README.md**: Removed old "Volume Signal (Ampelsystem)" section (~33 lines)
  - Old signal table and implementation notes removed
  - Replaced with "Fear & Greed Index" section
  - Logic now documented as part of Market Conditions Card

- **index.html**: Removed deprecated asset links
  - Removed `<link>` to `assets/taostats/taostats-card.css`
  - Removed `<script>` for `assets/taostats/taostats-card.js`

- **Assets deleted**: Removed `assets/taostats/` folder entirely
  - `taostats-card.css` (3 KB)
  - `taostats-card.html` (1 KB)
  - `taostats-card.js` (6 KB)

**Result**: -313 lines of redundant code removed

### Git Tags Created
**Retroactive tags** for previous RC25 releases:

- `v1.0.0-rc.25.2` - Visual Hierarchy Polish
- `v1.0.0-rc.25.3` - Label Clarity & Polish
- `v1.0.0-rc.25.3.1` - Mobile Phase Section Fix

These tags are now available in GitHub Releases for easier navigation.

## Improved

## Impact
