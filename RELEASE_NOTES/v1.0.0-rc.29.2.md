# Release v1.0.0-rc.29.2

**Release Date:** 2025-12-11

## Fixed

### Mobile Pill Spacing
Tighter gap between halving and price pills on mobile devices:
- Gap reduced: 14px → 8px at 480px, 6px → 5px at 400px
- More compact price pill padding and currency toggle

### Toggle Mutual Exclusion
Bidirectional exclusion between chart modes now complete:
- **Compare → disables Candle + Volume** (existing behavior)
- **Candle → disables Compare** (new)
- **Volume → disables Compare** (new)

This ensures consistent behavior: Candle/Volume and Compare modes are mutually exclusive in both directions.

### Time Range Toggle Preservation
Switching between timeframes (24h, 7d, 30d, etc.) no longer resets Candle/Volume/Compare toggle states. Previously, clicking a time range button would inadvertently remove the active class from all toggles.

### Easter Egg Frequency
Reduced visual noise from Matrix-themed Easter eggs:
- **Matrix glitch**: Now triggers every 3rd auto-refresh instead of every refresh
- **"Wake up, Neo"**: Appears after 5th refresh instead of on page load, positioned in bottom-left corner
