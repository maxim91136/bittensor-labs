# v1.0.0-rc.19.1

A small, safe patch release on top of RC19 containing UX and diagnostics fixes and conservative improvements to the Volume/Market detector.

Highlights
- Restore and consolidate RC19 baseline UI (index, script, style) and remove experimental Taobubbles artifacts.
- Improve API status tooltip: per-source AMPEL, per-metric source lines (Price, CircSupply), last-checked time and background probe for CoinGecko.
- Fix initialization race and overlay hang: terminal boot overlay now force-hides after 5s fallback to avoid init blocking.
- Volume/Market detector improvements:
  - Correct USD→TAO traded-share calculation (uses `lastPrice`) to avoid unit mismatch.
  - Immediate sustained detection when traded-share or strong price move is present (no hysteresis for clear cases).
  - Conservative thresholds tuned to avoid false positives on TAO's thin markets.
  - Tooltip clarifications to distinguish low-volume price spikes from sustained buying.
- UI cleanup: removed injected `stat-sub` subtitle that shifted cards, and cleaned up residual elements.
- Misc: small robustness fixes, duplicate `const` declaration removed, and several small bugfixes to keep `main` aligned with RC19.

Notes
- This is a minimal, safe release intended to restore RC19 behavior while adding a small set of diagnostics and conservative market-signal improvements.
- If you want a deeper telemetry/backtest pass to tune thresholds, see follow-up tasks in the backlog.
