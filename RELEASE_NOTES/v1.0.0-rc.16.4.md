# v1.0.0-rc.16.4

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

## Fix

- **CSS Signal Persistence:** Added `!important` flag to all volume signal animations to prevent style override by generic `.stat-card:hover` rules
- Signal colors (red, green, yellow, orange) now persist correctly during hover interactions and after auto-refresh cycles

## Technical Details

The generic `.stat-card:hover` rule was declared after the blink-specific hover rules in the CSS cascade, causing it to override the signal colors. By adding `!important` to both the base animation classes and hover states, the signal colors are now properly enforced regardless of CSS cascade order.
