# Release Notes: v1.0.0-rc.6

**Release Date:** 29. November 2025

## 🎯 Summary
RC6 introduces improved Volume 24h card with static color-based alerts and refined link styling for better UX clarity.

## ✨ Features
- **Volume 24h Card Alert System**: Static color-based visual feedback
  - 🟢 Green background when volume change is positive
  - 🔴 Red background when volume change is negative
  - Strong 2px borders with 40% opacity for clear visibility
  - Tooltip with percentage change and confidence level (no visible badge)
  
## 🔧 Changes

### Volume Card Improvements
- Removed pulsing animation in favor of static color alerts
- Simplified threshold logic: any positive % → green, any negative % → red (no ENTER/EXIT hysteresis)
- Inline styles ensure animation rules are not overridden by global CSS
- Removed small browser tooltip from card (only info-badge tooltip remains)
- Cleaned up tooltip formatting (newline instead of em-dash)

### Link Styling
- **Subnets & Validators**: Links now only on text values, not entire card
- Added underline to indicate clickable text
- Links inherit stat-value color (white in dark mode, black in light mode)
- Improved visual hierarchy and accessibility

### CSS & JS Optimization
- Removed animation rules from `.stat-card.pulse-up/down` (only static styles)
- Streamlined `applyToLegacy()` and `applyToCard()` functions
- Force inline styles in JS to bypass CSS override issues
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` without blocking visual feedback

## 🐛 Fixes
- Fixed animation blockade from `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
- Removed duplicate browser tooltips
- Fixed `.stat-card` animation not applying due to CSS specificity
- Resolved pulsing effect persisting despite CSS removal

## 📊 Technical Details
- **Aggregates API**: `/api/taostats_aggregates` returns `pct_change_vs_ma_short` and `pct_change_vs_ma_med`
- **Poll Interval**: 60 seconds
- **Thresholds**: Any non-zero percentage triggers the color change
- **Confidence Levels**: low, medium, high (displayed in tooltip)

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations
1. Verify Volume 24h card displays correct color based on percentage (green/red)
2. Check tooltip appears on (i) badge with percentage and confidence
3. Test Subnets/Validators links are underlined and functional
4. Verify no pulsing animation on Volume Card
5. Test both Dark Mode and Light Mode color inheritance
6. Check mobile responsiveness of card layout

## 📝 Notes
- Volume data is aggregated from the last 18 snapshots (approximately 3 hours of history)
- The color-based alert system provides at-a-glance market sentiment
- Next release will consider additional volume metrics and trend indicators
