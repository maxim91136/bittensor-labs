# v1.0.0-rc.3 (Release Candidate)

## Highlights
- Sequential halving projection simulation in the backend producer: emission halves step-wise per-threshold.
- Producer now records per-step projection fields (`emission_used`, `step`, `delta`) and diagnostics for improved UI and debugging.
- API worker exposes the new projection metadata (`halving_estimates`, `avg_emission_for_projection`, `projection_method`, `projection_confidence`, `projection_days_used`, `history_samples`).
- Frontend UX: Emission card now displays `AVG. EMISSION / DAY` using `avg_emission_for_projection` and halving pill tooltips surface projection metadata + confidence.
- Tooltip UX improvements: persistent mobile halving tooltip, wider desktop halving tooltip, and confidence-colored halving pill.

## Added
- Backend: Sequential halving simulation that reduces emission after each threshold in the projection loop. This prevents previous behavior where the same emission rate was used across all thresholds.
- Backend: `emission_used`, `step`, and `delta` fields added to each `halving_estimates` entry. These are stored in Cloudflare KV and surfaced via the API.
- API: New top-level projection metadata fields in `network.json` — `avg_emission_for_projection`, `projection_method`, `projection_confidence`, `projection_days_used`, `history_samples`, `per_interval_samples`, `days_of_history`.
- Frontend: Tooltip content for halving pill now includes next 3 halving steps, the projection method, and confidence; halving pill receives `confidence-low|medium|high` styles.

## Changed
- Frontend `script.js`: prefer `avg_emission_for_projection` when rendering the Emission KPI and when calculating halving ETAs.
- Tooltip system: reads `data-tooltip` at event time, supports a `wide` variant for desktop, and adds persistent behavior for mobile taps.
- Styling: added `.dynamic-tooltip.wide` and CSS rules for halving pill confidence accents (light and dark modes).

## Fixed
- Halving projection correctness: previous producer used a single emission value for all thresholds; projections now simulate emission halving sequentially.
