# Release v1.0.0-rc.16.2

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Signal Persistence on API Errors

Fixed an issue where the volume signal animation would reset to neutral (no animation) when the history API temporarily failed or returned insufficient data.

#### The Problem
- Every 60s refresh would call `updateVolumeSignal`
- If history API failed or returned no data → signal = "neutral"
- All blink classes were removed, animation stopped
- Default hover styles (green) would then show

#### The Fix
- Added `_lastVolumeSignal` state variable to track last valid signal
- If current calculation returns "neutral" but we had a previous valid signal → keep it
- Animation only changes when we have NEW valid data
- Truly neutral market conditions still show no animation

## Previous Fixes (rc.16.1)

- Explicit border-color on each blink class
- Proper hover style overrides per signal color
- Cleaner CSS without `!important` in keyframes
