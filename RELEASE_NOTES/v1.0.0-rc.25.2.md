# v1.0.0-rc.25.2 (2025-12-08)

Visual refinement update - strategic color usage for clearer information hierarchy.

## Changed

### Dollar Volume Display
- **Volume 24h metric** now shows both actual dollar amount and percentage change
  - Main value: Dollar amount (e.g., "$171.6M") in white/neutral
  - Sub value: Percentage change (e.g., "+144.3%") conditionally colored
  - New `formatCompactVolume()` function for clean formatting
  - Fully responsive across all screen sizes

### Color Strategy Refinement
**Problem**: When all metrics were bullish, the entire card became overwhelmingly green - difficult to scan and visually fatiguing.

**Solution**: Neutral colors for values, conditional colors for signals only.

- **Neutral/White values** (informational):
  - Dollar amounts: $171.6M (Volume), $169.64M (MA values)
  - All metric labels: VOLUME 24H, PRICE 24H, PHASE, MA-2h, MA-4h, etc.
  - Section titles: MOVING AVERAGES
  - Dark mode: Light gray (rgba(229,231,235,0.6-0.7))
  - Light mode: Dark gray (rgba(55,65,81,0.6-0.7))

- **Conditional colors** (semantic signals):
  - **Green**: Positive percentage changes (+144.3%, +5.9%, +1.2%)
  - **Red**: Negative percentage changes (-5.3%, -2.1%)
  - Applied to: Volume %, Price %, MA % changes

- **Signal badges** (market status):
  - Signal: 🟢 Bullish / 🔴 Bearish / 🟠 Watch / 🟡 Caution
  - Phase: Bullish / Bearish / Neutral (colored text)

### Information Hierarchy

**Before**: Everything green → visual noise, hard to scan
**After**: Strategic color usage → clear visual hierarchy

1. **Most important** (colored): Market signals and trend directions
2. **Supporting data** (neutral): Actual values and labels
3. **Context** (subtle): Section headers and descriptive text

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-optimized font sizes for dual-value metrics
- Tablet: 1.2em main / 0.75em sub
- Mobile: 1.1em main / 0.7em sub
- Full light/dark mode support maintained

## Impact

- **Reduced visual fatigue** - Less overwhelming when bullish
- **Faster scanning** - Eye drawn to signals, not decoration
- **Clearer meaning** - Color = signal/trend, not just aesthetics
- **Better readability** - Neutral values easier to read
- **Professional polish** - Intentional design vs. color noise

## Files Changed

- `market-conditions.js`: Added `formatCompactVolume()`, conditional color classes
- `market-conditions.css`: Neutral label colors, conditional percentage styles
- `VERSION`: Bumped to v1.0.0-rc.25.2
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Updated with RC25.2 entry

## Notes

- Pure UX/UI refinement pass
- No functional changes to data or logic
- Maintains all RC25/RC25.1 features
- Color now serves semantic purpose, not just decoration

Visual hierarchy perfected. Color = meaning. 🎨
