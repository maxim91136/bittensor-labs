# Release v1.0.0-rc.18

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

## ✨ UI Polish
- **Light-Mode Price Pill Stripe:** Neutralizes the top/left/bottom borders so only the right-edge accent remains visible. The stripe now starts with the brand teal and flips to green (24h up) or red (24h down) exactly like dark mode.
- **Halving Pill Brightness:** Refreshed the coral gradient, border, and light-mode accent stripe for better readability and parity between modes without sacrificing the premium glow.

## 🛠️ Fixes
- Removed the stray left-edge stripe that previously appeared in light mode when the price pill loaded before the 24h delta was known.
- Ensured the right-edge stripe keeps its per-state inset glow in light mode so users can read trend direction even against pale backgrounds.

## ✅ Verification Checklist
- Toggle the theme switch: confirm both pills keep a single accent stripe on their intended edge.
- Force positive/negative mock data (or wait for live changes) and verify the price pill’s stripe color matches the 24h change in both themes.
- Inspect the halving countdown in light mode to confirm the softened coral stripe and brighter base remain legible against the page background.
