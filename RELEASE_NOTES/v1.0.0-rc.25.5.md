# v1.0.0-rc.25.5 (2025-12-08)

Mobile readability & dual-label market analysis.

## Improved

### Mobile Font Sizes
- **Moving Averages**: 25-30% larger font sizes across all breakpoints
- **Market Phase Section**: Increased from 0.8em to 1em (desktop), 0.9em (mobile)
- Better readability for older users and smaller screens

### Market Phase Labels - Dual Format
Each market condition now shows **both** emotional and technical interpretation:

**Bullish Market:**
```
📈 Market: Bullish (+22.5% 3d/7d)
⚠️ Sentiment: Extreme Greed (75)
🌡️ overheating?
📊 max optimism
```

**Bearish Market:**
```
📉 Market: Bearish (-22.5% 3d/7d)
🔻 Sentiment: Extreme Fear (20)
💀 capitulation?
📊 max selling pressure
```

**Neutral Market:**
```
➡️ Market: Neutral (+2.5% 3d/7d)
⚠️ Sentiment: Extreme Greed (80)
🎯 correction?
📊 high sentiment
```

### Shorter Market Labels
- Before: `Market: Bearish (3d avg is 22.5% below 7d avg)`
- After: `Market: Bearish (-22.5% 3d/7d)`
- ~50% shorter, fits better on mobile

### Clean Line Breaks
- Each label on separate line (no mid-text wrapping)
- Every line starts with emoji for visual consistency
- No more "unsauber" formatting on small screens

## Legal Safety

- Removed all investment advice language
- Emotional labels end with `?` (questions, not statements)
- Technical labels are purely descriptive (no recommendations)
- Examples: "capitulation?" not "capitulation", "📊 max selling pressure" not "sell now"

## All Phase Combinations

| Market | Sentiment | Emotional | Technical |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Bullish | Extreme Greed | 🌡️ overheating? | 📊 max optimism |
| Bullish | Greed | ✨ euphoria? | 📊 high optimism |

| Bearish | Extreme Fear | 💀 capitulation? | 📊 max selling pressure |
