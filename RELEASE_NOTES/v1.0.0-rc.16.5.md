# v1.0.0-rc.16.5

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

## Fix

- **Signal Persistence:** Once a colored signal (red/green/yellow/orange) is set, it now persists until a DIFFERENT colored signal is detected
- Neutral states are always ignored when a color is already active
- This prevents signal loss during auto-refresh cycles when market conditions temporarily fall within the ±3% neutral threshold

## Technical Details

Previously, if the volume/price changes fell within ±3% during an auto-refresh, the signal would return to "neutral" and remove all animation classes. Now, neutral signals are completely ignored once any colored signal is active - only a different color can override the current signal.
