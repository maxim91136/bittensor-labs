# v1.0.0-rc.25.3 (2025-12-08)

UX refinement update - improved clarity and mobile optimization.

## Changed

### Metric Label Evolution
Progressive refinement of the fourth metric label for maximum clarity:

- **Phase** → **MA Trend** → **Price Trend** → **Price Trend (3d vs. 7d)** → **Trend (3d/7d)**

**Final result: "Trend (3d/7d)"**
- Clear: Shows this is a trend indicator
- Specific: Timeframes (3d/7d) indicate what's being compared
- Compact: Mobile-friendly without sacrificing understanding
- Contextual: Works perfectly within Market Conditions card

### The Four Metrics (Final State)
1. **Signal** 🟢 Bullish - Multi-factor short-term signal
2. **Volume 24h** $180.1M / +145.4% - Trading volume
3. **Price 24h** +6.3% - Short-term price change
4. **Trend (3d/7d)** Bullish - Medium-term price trend (3-day vs 7-day MA comparison)

### Visual Refinement
- **Centered Values**: All metric values now centered horizontally and vertically within cards
  - Better visual balance
  - More polished appearance
  - Signal card maintains horizontal layout

### Problem → Solution Journey

**Initial Problem**: "Phase" was ambiguous
- Users didn't know what it represented
- Confusion with "Signal" metric

**Iteration Process**:
1. "MA Trend" - Better, but still vague
2. "Price Trend" - Clearer, but missing timeframe
3. "Price Trend (3d vs. 7d)" - Perfect clarity, but too long for mobile
4. **"Trend (3d/7d)"** - ✅ Sweet spot: Clear, compact, informative

## Improved

- **Label Clarity**: Users now understand each metric at a glance
- **Mobile Experience**: Compact labels fit well on small screens
- **Visual Polish**: Centered values create balanced card layouts
- **Reduced Confusion**: Clear distinction between Signal (multi-factor) and Trend (MA-based)

## Impact

- **Better UX**: No more guessing what "Phase" means
- **Faster Scanning**: Metric labels are concise and descriptive
- **Professional Polish**: Centered layout looks more refined
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Compact labels work on all screen sizes
