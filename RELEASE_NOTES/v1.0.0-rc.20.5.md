# v1.0.0-rc.20.5 (2025-12-05)

## Summary
RC20.5 feintuned all workflow schedules to avoid round times and spread load more evenly across the hour. This should reduce API and Cloudflare KV errors due to request bursts and improve overall reliability. No functional or UI changes.

## Changed
- All non-backup GitHub Actions workflow schedules have been adjusted to use non-round, staggered minutes (see repository for details).
- No code or UI changes, only workflow timing.

## Notes
- This release is infrastructure-focused. For previous feature and UI changes, see `RELEASE_NOTES/v1.0.0-rc.20.4.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Version bumped to `v1.0.0-rc.20.5`.
