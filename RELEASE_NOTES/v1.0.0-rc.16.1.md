# Release v1.0.0-rc.16.1

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Persistent Blink Animation Fix

Fixed an issue where the volume signal border animation would revert to green (default hover color) instead of maintaining the correct signal color.

#### The Problem
- Border animation would show correct color initially
- After hovering or after some time, it would switch to green
- CSS hover styles were overriding the animation border-color

#### The Fix
- Explicit border-color set on each `.stat-card.blink-X` class
- Hover styles now explicitly maintain the signal color
- Removed problematic `!important` declarations in keyframes
- Cleaner CSS structure with proper specificity

## 🚦 Volume Signal System (from rc.16)

Real-time monitoring signal for the Volume 24h card based on volume and price correlation:

| Volume Δ | Price Δ | Signal | Meaning |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| ↑ > +3% | ↑ > +3% | 🟢 **Green** | Bullish - Strong demand |
| ↑ > +3% | ↓ < -3% | 🔴 **Red** | Bearish - Distribution |
| ↑ > +3% | stable | 🟠 **Orange** | Potential breakout |
| ↓ < -3% | any | 🟡 **Yellow** | Consolidation |
| stable | any | ⚪ **Neutral** | No animation |

### Visual Design
- Smooth 6s "breathing" border animation
- Animation persists on hover
- Tooltip shows detailed breakdown
