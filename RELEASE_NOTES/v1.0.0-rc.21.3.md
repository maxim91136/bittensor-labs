# v1.0.0-rc.21.3 (2025-12-06)

Small frontend follow-up focused on documentation and source attributions plus minor layout polishing.

### Highlights

- Docs: Disclaimer updated to explicitly attribute Fear & Greed Index values to `alternative.me`.
- Layout: Data sources grid changed to a compact 4×2 layout; one slot intentionally left empty for future links.
- UI: Minor polish to F&G card (timeline styling, Matrix monospace font, easter-egg placement) and light-mode asset fallbacks.
- Dev: Release notes cleaned; no behavioral backend changes.

### Notes

Low-risk frontend release. Recommended: hard-refresh or open in incognito to ensure updated assets and tooltip text appear correctly.
