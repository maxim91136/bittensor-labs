# v1.0.0-rc.19

Release Candidate 19 — Key changes and notes

Highlights
- Top-10 History collection and APIs
  - Added scheduled collector (GitHub Actions) and worker API endpoints:
    - `/api/top_validators_history`
    - `/api/top_wallets_history`
    - `/api/top_subnets_history`
  - History snapshots stored in Cloudflare KV; workflow now runs every 30 minutes (`:13, :43`).
- UI improvements
  - Price Pill: always shows a border state with three classes (`price-up`, `price-down`, `price-neutral`) for consistent visual feedback (dark & light modes).
  - Subtle pill discovery hint implemented (`[pill me]`).
  - Terminal boot intro (Matrix-style) added on page load; dispatches `terminalBootDone` to avoid init race conditions.
- Robustness & fixes
  - Fixed race condition where the dashboard init could be blocked by the overlay; added init guards and re-init on `terminalBootDone`.
  - Added fallback checks to ensure auto-refresh starts even if init failed.
  - Publish script writes `.github/data/top_history_latest.json` as a local backup during workflow runs.

Notes
- Trend Badges (frontend) are intentionally blocked until sufficient history snapshots are available (recommended threshold: ~48 snapshots ≈24 hours at 30-minute cadence).
- R2 backup and CI smoke tests remain on the roadmap.

Testing
- Verify history endpoints: `/api/top_validators_history?latest=1` and plain `/api/top_validators_history`.
- Monitor KV `top_*_history` keys for growth; expect 30-minute cadence snapshots.

Changelog
- See individual commits for details: price-pill, terminal-boot, publish_top_history.py, workflow schedule change, API endpoints for history.
